# Polynomial Chaos Theory: Application to the stability of Uncertain Delay Differential Equations

## UPDATE: Polynomial (chaos) approximation of the spectral Abscissa

Further analysis and matlab file are available for polynomial (chaos) approximation of the spectral abscissa. 

The recent developments explicit the parallelism between polynomial chaos theory and polynomial approximation, reviewing the convergence results of this latter framework.

## Matlab codes

In this repository, all the Matlab codes, used for developing my Master Thesis: *"Polynomial Chaos Theory: Application to the stability of Uncertain Delay Differential Equations"*, are collected. 
The thesis furnishes all the theoretical bases and the motivations for implementing the codes that you find in these folders. Moreover, the notation used to develop the code is taken by the thesis.

If you do not possess the Thesis and you want to see it please send an email to fenzi.luca@gmail.com. I am very glad to share this document with the interested people. 

For simplicity, the codes are divided in folders following the chapter of the thesis:


1. [Basic Concepts of Probability Theory](https://github.com/lucafe/PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes/tree/master/2ch_Probability) *2ch_Probability*

2. [Orthogonal Polynomials and Approximation Theory](https://github.com/lucafe/PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes/tree/master/3ch_Approximation) *3ch_Approximation*

3. [Polynomial Chaos Theory](https://github.com/lucafe/PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes/tree/master/4ch_PCE)   *4ch_PCE*

4. [Uncertain Delay Differential Equation](https://github.com/lucafe/PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes/tree/master/5ch_UDDE)  *5ch_UDDE*

5. [Computational Results](https://github.com/lucafe/PCE4UDDE_matlab_codes/tree/master/6ch_Results) *6ch_Results*

In every folder, you find another README file with a short explanation of the codes of the folder. 
In this folder, you can find only the Hard Cover of the thesis.

The codes are implemented in MATLAB r2015a, and they are extensively used to develop all the figures and the tables of my thesis. In particular, the figures and the tables were inserted in tex using the Matlab function [matlab2tikz](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022-matlab2tikz-matlab2tikz) and [matrix2latex](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4894-matrix2latex).

All the attendants are kindly invited and encouraged to report on possible (and inevitable) mistakes and improvements of the present codes. I appreciate every contribution and collaboration; feel free to write me.
